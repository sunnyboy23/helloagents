## What HelloAGENTS Does

AI coding CLIs can move fast, but they can also stop at advice, skip checks, lose project context, shift responsibility when tasks get hard, or report completion before the work is really done.

HelloAGENTS adds a workflow layer on top of Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI. It anchors the agent as a capable executor, blocks responsibility-shifting patterns, helps the agent choose the right path, use task-specific quality skills, keep a project knowledge base, and verify work before delivery.

| Problem | Without HelloAGENTS | With HelloAGENTS |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Stops too early | Ends with suggestions | Continues into build, verify, and closeout |
| Shifts responsibility | Refuses hard tasks, suggests other tools | Exhausts alternative paths, stays on task |
| Quality is inconsistent | Depends on each prompt | 14 quality skills activate by task type |
| Context is scattered | Plans live in chat history | Project knowledge and plan files stay on disk |
| Completion is vague | Natural language says “done” | Delivery checks use state, evidence, and verification |
| Config writes are risky | CLI files can drift | Install, update, cleanup, and doctor flows check managed files |

## Core Features

### 1) 14 built-in workflow skills

HelloAGENTS ships 14 built-in skills. They are loaded only when the current stage needs them, so simple tasks stay light while complex work gets stricter checks.

| Skill | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `hello-ui` | UI planning, design contracts, implementation mapping, visual validation |
| `hello-api` | API design, validation, error format, compatibility |
| `hello-security` | auth, secrets, permissions, injection risks |
| `hello-test` | TDD, coverage, edge cases, test structure |
| `qa-review` | unified quality review, verification commands, blocking fixes, delivery evidence, closeout |
| `helloagents` | command routing, workflow stage rules, project knowledge, and state coordination |
| `hello-errors` | error handling, logs, retry and recovery behavior |
| `hello-perf` | performance, caching, query and rendering risks |
| `hello-data` | database, migrations, transactions, indexes |
| `hello-arch` | architecture, boundaries, code size, maintainability |
| `hello-debug` | bug diagnosis and escalation when stuck |
| `hello-subagent` | subagent delegation and result integration |
| `hello-write` | documentation, reports, and written deliverables |
| `hello-reflect` | reusable lessons and knowledge updates |

All UI work first follows the shared UI quality baseline.
In host global mode, in initialized projects, or in explicit UI workflows, `hello-ui` adds deeper design-contract execution, design-system mapping, and visual validation on top of that baseline.
When visual evidence is required, HelloAGENTS records it in the current session `artifacts/visual.json`.

### 2) Commands for different work styles

Commands run inside the AI CLI chat with a `~` prefix. The command skill is read directly; unrelated skills are not loaded unless the workflow needs them.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `~idea` | Lightweight exploration and option comparison; does not write files |
| `~office` | Worth/scope review before planning; decides whether to do it, how big, and what the smallest wedge is |
| `~auto` | Chooses the main path and keeps going until delivery or a real blocker |
| `~plan` | Requirements, solution design, task breakdown, and plan package |
| `~build` | Implementation from the current request or an existing plan |
| `~prd` | Modern product requirements document through guided dimension-by-dimension exploration |
| `~loop` | Long-running entry; in Codex it prefers `/goal -> ~auto -> ~qa` |
| `~init` | Initialize the project workflow and sync project knowledge |
| `~test` | Write tests for a target module or recent change |
| `~qa` | Run the unified quality loop: review, verification commands, fixes, and closeout |
| `~commit` | Generate a conventional commit message and sync knowledge |
| `~clean` | Archive finished plans and clean temporary runtime files |
| `~help` | Show commands and current settings |

Compatibility aliases:

- `~do` → `~build`
- `~design` → `~plan`
- `~review` → `~qa`

Use `~idea` when you want to compare approaches. Use `~office` when you first need to decide whether the work is worth doing at all, how big it should be, and what the smallest wedge is.

### 3) Project knowledge base

HelloAGENTS can create and maintain a project knowledge base under `.helloagents/`.

The knowledge base helps future turns understand the repo without re-discovering the same facts. It can store:

| File or directory | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `context.md` | project overview, stack, architecture, module index |
| `guidelines.md` | non-obvious coding conventions inferred from the repo |
| `verify.yaml` | verification commands such as lint, test, build |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | project-level change history |
| `DESIGN.md` | stable UI design contract when the project has UI work |
| `modules/*.md` | module-specific notes and lessons |
| `plans/<feature>/` | active plan packages |
| `archive/` | archived plan packages |

`~init` initializes the project workflow: it writes the project-level full carrier marker, prepares project state, and creates or updates the knowledge base.

### 4) Structured plan packages

Complex work can be stored as plan packages instead of a single paragraph in chat.

For `~plan`, HelloAGENTS uses:

- `requirements.md`
- `plan.md`
- `tasks.md`
- `contract.json`

For `~prd`, HelloAGENTS also creates PRD files such as:

- `prd/00-overview.md`
- `prd/01-user-stories.md`
- `prd/02-functional.md`
- `prd/03-ui-design.md`
- `prd/04-technical.md`
- `prd/05-nonfunctional.md`
- `prd/06-i18n-l10n.md`
- `prd/07-accessibility.md`
- `prd/08-content.md`
- `prd/09-testing.md`
- `prd/10-deployment.md`
- `prd/11-legal-privacy.md`
- `prd/12-timeline.md`

`contract.json` is used by the workflow to decide `qaMode`, `qaFocus`, optional advisor checks, and optional visual validation.

`tasks.md` also includes a Codex `/goal` entry. For long-running Codex work, use that prepared entry instead of giving `/goal` a raw product document. The default chain is `/goal -> ~auto -> ~qa`: Codex keeps the long-running continuation, `~auto` executes the AFK work, and `~qa` remains the final quality gate before closeout.

### 5) State and recovery

Long tasks need a small recovery snapshot, but one shared state file is not safe enough for concurrent work.

HelloAGENTS now resolves the current state file from `state_path`:

- with a stable or reusable session id: `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/STATE.md`
- before a reusable session id is available: `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/default/STATE.md`

`<workspace>` is the current Git branch, `detached-<sha>` for a detached HEAD, or `workspace` for non-Git projects. `<session>` is the current project-local session token. `.helloagents/sessions/active.json` only keeps the latest active workspace/session mapping plus alias bridges, so the same CLI session stays in one directory and `/resume` can reuse it.

For project-local sessions, HelloAGENTS first uses stable host identifiers such as `sessionId`, `conversationId`, `threadId`, or `HELLOAGENTS_NOTIFY_SESSION_ID`. If the host only exposes a window or terminal id such as `WT_SESSION`, `TERM_SESSION_ID`, or `WINDOWID`, HelloAGENTS uses it only as a lightweight alias bridge and reuses the mapped session first instead of fanning out duplicate directories. If a session starts before a stable host identifier is available, HelloAGENTS can begin in `default` and keep reusing that same active directory after the same CLI session later exposes a stable identifier, instead of splitting into a second session directory.

`STATE.md` records where the current workflow stopped. It is not a universal memory file for every conversation. Codex `/goal` does not replace `state_path`, `turn-state`, or local evidence files; it only handles long-running continuation on the Codex side.

### 6) Verification and delivery evidence

HelloAGENTS does not treat “tests passed” and “task complete” as the same thing. Delivery can also require plan coverage, task checklist status, review evidence, advisor evidence, and visual evidence.

Runtime state now stays intentionally small:

- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/STATE.md`
- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/runtime.json`
- `.helloagents/sessions/active.json`
- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/artifacts/qa-review.json`
- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/artifacts/advisor.json`
- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/artifacts/visual.json`
- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/artifacts/closeout.json`
- optional `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/events.jsonl`
- `~/.codex/.helloagents/notify-state.json` for Codex-native closeout de-duplication only

`STATE.md` only keeps the human-readable recovery snapshot. `runtime.json` is machine-only and keeps the minimal runtime state. `artifacts/*.json` stays limited to structured receipts. `events.jsonl` remains opt-in trace output and stays off by default.
Project-local `STATE.md` is now materialized more lazily.

Standard runtime evidence and transient runtime state now expire after 72 hours. Long-running Codex goal flows still keep their 720-hour upper bound where the workflow explicitly needs it.

Delivery gate, guard, and QA gate messages use action-oriented wording such as processing path, closeout action, and visual validation action, so blocked flows show what to do next without turning executable steps into optional suggestions. Final closeout also enforces a single HelloAGENTS wrapper, so one reply does not emit duplicate closeout headers.
That wrapper is now reserved for direct final-user delivery only. Intermediate reports, delegated task results, and sub-agent replies stay natural, and sub-agent stop hooks reject wrapped closeout replies.

### 7) Safer install, update, cleanup, and diagnostics

The CLI manages host files explicitly:

- `install` writes only the selected target unless `--all` is used
- `update` refreshes the selected target or all targets
- `cleanup` removes managed injections and links
- `uninstall` performs scoped cleanup before package removal
- `doctor` reports drift in carriers, links, hooks, config entries, plugin roots, cache copies, versions, and real Claude/Gemini global install artifacts; for Codex, it also surfaces native `codex doctor` output when available
- Codex managed `notify = ["helloagents-js", "codex-notify"]` stays portable, and `doctor`, `cleanup`, and `uninstall` also recognize wrapped `--previous-notify` chains used by Codex App / Computer Use
- per-host mode tracking is written only after host setup succeeds, and failed native global cleanup keeps the host tracked as `global` instead of silently layering standby on top
- direct `switch-branch` clears stale `HELLOAGENTS*` lifecycle env before its internal npm install/sync steps, and package `preuninstall` falls back to `--all` when no explicit host args are provided, so stale shell env does not shrink branch-switch or uninstall cleanup scope
- Windows `.cmd` / `.bat` lifecycle calls now run through an explicit command wrapper, so host installs, branch switching, and doctor flows do not emit Node `DEP0190` shell deprecation warnings
- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI config writes, updates, cleanup, uninstall, mode switching, and branch switching are covered as one tested lifecycle chain instead of separate best-effort paths

## Quick Start

### 1) Install the package

```bash
npm install -g helloagents
```

If another executable named `helloagents` already exists in your `PATH`, use the stable managed-entry alias:

```bash
helloagents-js
```

By default, `postinstall` installs the package command, initializes `~/.helloagents/helloagents.json`, and syncs runtime files to `~/.helloagents/helloagents`. No host CLI is deployed unless you set `HELLOAGENTS=target[:mode]`, such as `HELLOAGENTS=codex:global`.

### 2) Deploy to a CLI

Use standby mode for selected projects and explicit activation:

```bash
helloagents install codex --standby
helloagents install --all --standby
```

Use global mode when you want full rules everywhere:

```bash
helloagents --global
helloagents install --all --global
```

After reinstalling, refreshing, or switching modes, restart the target AI CLI or open a new session; already running sessions do not reload injected rules automatically.

### 3) Verify inside your AI CLI

Type:

```text
~help
```

You should see the available chat commands and the current settings.

### 4) Create project knowledge

Initialize the project workflow:

```text
~init
```

## CLI Management

### Shell commands

```bash
helloagents --standby
helloagents --global
helloagents install codex --standby
helloagents install --all --global
helloagents update codex
helloagents cleanup claude --global
helloagents uninstall gemini
helloagents switch-branch beta
helloagents switch-branch beta claude --global
helloagents doctor
helloagents doctor codex --json
helloagents codex goals status
helloagents codex goals enable
```

Supported targets:

- `claude`
- `gemini`
- `codex`
- `--all`

If you omit `--standby` or `--global`, HelloAGENTS first reuses the tracked/detected mode for that CLI, then falls back to `standby`.

### npm and one-shot script entries

Use these when you do not want to depend on the `helloagents` binary being available during package updates. In `HELLOAGENTS=target[:mode]`, target can be `all`, `claude`, `gemini`, or `codex`; mode can be `standby` or `global`. For install, an omitted mode is treated as `standby`. For update, cleanup, uninstall, and branch switching, an omitted mode is forwarded unchanged so HelloAGENTS can reuse the tracked or detected mode for that CLI first. If you do not provide `HELLOAGENTS`, the one-shot install scripts now behave like plain package install: they install or update the package only and do not auto-deploy any host CLI. For a custom tarball or package spec, set `HELLOAGENTS_PACKAGE` instead of `HELLOAGENTS_BRANCH`. For a guaranteed refresh of an already installed package, prefer `npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run sync-hosts -- ...` after the package command.

Host configs use the stable `helloagents-js` entrypoint and runtime root `~/.helloagents/helloagents`, so Node global package paths can change without breaking managed hooks or Codex `notify`. Codex hooks use standalone `~/.codex/hooks.json` instead of adding large hook blocks to `config.toml`, and Codex global plugin roots plus plugin cache now link back to that same stable runtime root. Claude Code global installs now use a dedicated local marketplace projection under `~/.helloagents/host-projections/claude-marketplace`, and Gemini global extension packaging uses `~/.helloagents/host-projections/gemini`, so host-specific packaging stays isolated from the shared runtime root.

#### npm commands

macOS / Linux:

```bash
# Install to Codex in standby mode
HELLOAGENTS=codex npm install -g helloagents

# Install to Codex in global mode
HELLOAGENTS=codex:global npm install -g helloagents

# Update the package, then refresh Claude in standby mode
npm update -g helloagents
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run sync-hosts -- claude --standby

# Switch to the beta branch, then refresh all CLIs in standby mode
npm install -g https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents/archive/refs/heads/beta.tar.gz
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run sync-hosts -- --all --standby

# Clean Gemini integration before package uninstall
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run uninstall -- gemini --standby
npm uninstall -g helloagents
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
# Install to Codex in standby mode
$env:HELLOAGENTS="codex"; npm install -g helloagents

# Install to Codex in global mode
$env:HELLOAGENTS="codex:global"; npm install -g helloagents

# Update the package, then refresh Claude in standby mode
npm update -g helloagents
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run sync-hosts -- claude --standby

# Switch to the beta branch, then refresh all CLIs in standby mode
npm install -g https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents/archive/refs/heads/beta.tar.gz
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run sync-hosts -- --all --standby

# Clean Gemini integration before package uninstall
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run uninstall -- gemini --standby
npm uninstall -g helloagents
```

After the package is installed, you can also call its npm scripts directly:

```bash
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run deploy:global
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run sync-hosts -- --all --standby
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run cleanup-hosts -- codex --standby
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run uninstall -- --all
```

Fresh installs can still use `HELLOAGENTS=target[:mode]` directly. For update, branch switching, or any forced host re-sync of an already installed package, the explicit `npm run sync-hosts` step above is the deterministic path.

#### One-shot scripts

macOS / Linux:

```bash
# Install
HELLOAGENTS=codex curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | sh

# Update
HELLOAGENTS=claude:standby HELLOAGENTS_ACTION=update curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | sh

# Switch branch
HELLOAGENTS=all:global HELLOAGENTS_ACTION=switch-branch HELLOAGENTS_BRANCH=beta curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | sh

# Cleanup host integration without uninstalling the package
HELLOAGENTS=codex:standby HELLOAGENTS_ACTION=cleanup curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | sh

# Uninstall
HELLOAGENTS=gemini HELLOAGENTS_ACTION=uninstall curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
# Install
$env:HELLOAGENTS="codex"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Update
$env:HELLOAGENTS="claude:standby"; $env:HELLOAGENTS_ACTION="update"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Switch branch
$env:HELLOAGENTS="all:global"; $env:HELLOAGENTS_ACTION="switch-branch"; $env:HELLOAGENTS_BRANCH="beta"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Cleanup host integration without uninstalling the package
$env:HELLOAGENTS="codex:standby"; $env:HELLOAGENTS_ACTION="cleanup"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Uninstall
$env:HELLOAGENTS="gemini"; $env:HELLOAGENTS_ACTION="uninstall"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hellowind777/helloagents/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The shell and PowerShell wrappers now parse `HELLOAGENTS` once, keep plain package install/update behavior when no target is specified, clear lifecycle env before update, branch switching, and uninstall, and then run one explicit sync or cleanup path.

### Branch switching

`switch-branch` installs the requested npm/GitHub ref first, then syncs host CLIs through npm scripts so it does not depend on the `helloagents` executable during updates:

```bash
helloagents switch-branch beta
helloagents switch-branch beta claude --global
helloagents branch beta --all --standby
```

The direct `helloagents switch-branch ...` command also clears stale `HELLOAGENTS*` lifecycle env before its internal npm install and host-sync steps.

Use normal npm commands when you only want to change the package and not sync host CLIs immediately:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/hellowind777/helloagents/archive/refs/heads/beta.tar.gz
npm update -g helloagents
npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run uninstall -- --all
npm uninstall -g helloagents
```

### Standby mode files

| CLI | Files written or updated | Cleanup behavior |
|-----|--------------------------|------------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/helloagents -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents` | removes managed marker block, HelloAGENTS hooks/permissions, and symlink |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.gemini/settings.json`, `~/.gemini/helloagents -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents` | removes managed marker block, HelloAGENTS hooks, and symlink |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, `~/.codex/helloagents -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents`, managed backups | removes managed marker block, managed config keys, managed hooks, symlink, and the latest managed backup |

### Global mode files

| CLI | Install method | Files involved |
|-----|----------------|----------------|
| Claude Code | native plugin install | `~/.helloagents/host-projections/claude-marketplace`, Claude Code plugin metadata/cache managed by the host |
| Gemini CLI | native extension install | `~/.helloagents/host-projections/gemini`, `~/.gemini/extensions/helloagents` |
| Codex CLI | native local-plugin chain | `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `~/plugins/helloagents/ -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents`, `~/.codex/plugins/cache/local-plugins/helloagents/local/ -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.codex/hooks.json`, `~/.codex/helloagents -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents` |

In global mode, HelloAGENTS now attempts the host-native install commands automatically. Claude Code uses the local marketplace projection, Gemini uses the local extension projection, and Codex keeps linking back to the same stable runtime root, so install, update, branch switching, mode switching, cleanup, and uninstall all refresh against one consistent runtime copy. If a host command is unavailable, run the same commands manually:

```text
/plugin marketplace add "~/.helloagents/host-projections/claude-marketplace"
/plugin install helloagents@helloagents
gemini extensions link "~/.helloagents/host-projections/gemini"
```

For Claude Code, the CLI also tries the equivalent `claude plugin marketplace add ...` and `claude plugin install ...` commands. The marketplace is named `helloagents`, and the plugin is also named `helloagents`, so the install target is `helloagents@helloagents`. Restart the host CLI after a global install.

When you switch Claude or Gemini back to standby, HelloAGENTS first removes the native plugin or extension. If that cleanup fails, the host stays tracked as `global` instead of silently stacking standby on top.

Codex global mode is installed by HelloAGENTS automatically through the local-plugin path.

## Commands in Chat

### Typical flows

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Compare ideas before writing files | `~idea "compare two API designs"` |
| Decide whether something is worth doing and how small to start | `~office "should this become a full platform or just a thin wedge?"` |
| Let HelloAGENTS choose the path and continue | `~auto "add JWT login"` |
| Review a plan before implementation | `~plan "refactor payment module"` |
| Implement from a clear request or active plan | `~build "finish task 2 in the plan"` |
| Build a full product requirement document | `~prd "modern dashboard for operations team"` |
| Run a long Codex task through `/goal -> ~auto -> ~qa` | `~loop "finish the auth refactor"` |
| Initialize or refresh the project workflow | `~init` |
| Validate current work | `~qa` |
| Generate commit message and sync knowledge | `~commit` |

### Project initialization vs host global deployment

In standby mode, projects that are not initialized get lighter rules and explicit `~command` entry points. A project becomes initialized after `~init` writes the project-level `<!-- HELLOAGENTS_PROFILE: full -->` marker.

In global mode, HelloAGENTS applies full rules by default at the host level.

## Project Knowledge Base

### Local mode

By default, project knowledge lives in the project:

```text
.helloagents/
```

This directory is the local knowledge, plan, state, and runtime directory.

### Repo-shared mode

When `project_store_mode = "repo-shared"`:

- local `.helloagents/` keeps project-local state and runtime files
- stable knowledge and plan files move to `~/.helloagents/projects/<repo-key>/`
- multiple worktrees of the same git repo can share the same stable knowledge

Runtime state and evidence remain local to the working project:

- `state_path`
- `.helloagents/sessions/active.json`
- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/runtime.json`
- `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/artifacts/*.json`

### Temporary sessions outside project-local storage

For read-only work with no local output, if neither the current directory nor its parents contain a project-local `.helloagents/` directory, HelloAGENTS keeps short-lived runtime state under the user-level directory:

```text
~/.helloagents/runtime/<scope-key>/
```

This only stores short-lived `STATE.md`, `runtime.json`, and `artifacts/`. Optional `events.jsonl` trace files are only written when trace mode is enabled. It is not project knowledge. Expired transient sessions are removed by TTL cleanup.

Once the task creates or modifies local files, or otherwise leaves local output in the current project, HelloAGENTS creates the project-local `.helloagents/sessions/<workspace>/<session>/STATE.md` automatically instead of keeping that task only in the user-level transient runtime.

### Knowledge creation rules

| Command or setting | Behavior |
|--------------------|----------|
| `~init` | initializes the project workflow and syncs the knowledge base |
| `kb_create_mode = 0` | disables automatic knowledge updates |
| `kb_create_mode = 1` | syncs knowledge automatically only when the KB already exists |
| `kb_create_mode = 2` | for coding tasks, auto-creates or syncs the KB when it already exists or the project is initialized |

## Workflow and Delivery

### Workflow stages

HelloAGENTS uses this stage model for structured work:

```text
Routing and tiering → Goal clarification → Planning → Implementation → Quality loop → Closeout and archive
```

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Routing and tiering` | decide whether the task should go through `~idea`, `~office`, `~plan`, `~build`, `~qa`, `~prd`, or automatic flow |
| `Goal clarification` | clarify goal, constraints, and success criteria |
| `Planning` | prepare plan files and choose needed skills |
| `Implementation` | implement and run local checks |
| `Quality loop` | review, run commands, and check contract and evidence |
| `Closeout and archive` | update state, knowledge, and closeout evidence |

HelloAGENTS also keeps an always-on core-rule layer in `bootstrap.md` / `bootstrap-lite.md`.
That layer anchors the agent as a capable executor in a trusted environment, blocks responsibility-shifting to users or other tools, enforces exhausting alternative paths before declaring blockage, corrects proposal bias, distinguishes real external constraints from internal inertia, and keeps user-visible wording in one language unless code identifiers, commands, paths, config keys, or necessary proper names must stay unchanged.

### Delivery tiers

| Tier | Typical use |
|------|-------------|
| `T0` | read-only analysis, idea exploration, comparison |
| `T1` | low-risk focused fixes or explicit verification |
| `T2` | multi-file features, new projects, structured plans |
| `T3` | high-risk or irreversible work such as auth, payment, database, release, production operations |

### UI workflow

UI work follows this priority:

1. current `plan.md` or PRD UI decisions
2. `.helloagents/DESIGN.md`
3. any loaded `hello-ui` implementation and validation rules; all UI work must still satisfy the shared UI quality baseline

For heavier UI work, `contract.json` can require:

- `ui.styleAdvisor.required`
- `ui.visualValidation.required`

Those requirements are closed with the current session `artifacts/advisor.json` and `artifacts/visual.json`.

### Verification sources

Verification commands are detected in this order:

1. logical `.helloagents/verify.yaml`
2. package manager scripts such as `package.json`
3. automatic detection

When `project_store_mode = "repo-shared"`, logical `.helloagents/verify.yaml` resolves from the shared project store.

## Configuration

Config file:

```text
~/.helloagents/helloagents.json
```

Default shape:

```json
{
  "output_language": "",
  "output_format": true,
  "notify_level": 0,
  "ralph_loop_enabled": true,
  "guard_enabled": true,
  "kb_create_mode": 1,
  "project_store_mode": "local",
  "auto_commit_enabled": true,
  "commit_attribution": "",
  "install_mode": "standby",
  "host_install_modes": {}
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `output_language` | `""` | follow the user language unless set |
| `output_format` | `true` | direct final-user closeout from the main agent uses the HelloAGENTS layout; intermediate, delegated, and sub-agent output stays natural |
| `notify_level` | `0` | `0` off, `1` desktop, `2` sound, `3` both |
| `ralph_loop_enabled` | `true` | run the QA stop gate for explicit `~qa` / `~loop` or required closeout gates |
| `guard_enabled` | `true` | block dangerous commands |
| `kb_create_mode` | `1` | `0` off, `1` sync existing KB automatically, `2` auto-create or sync the KB for coding tasks |
| `project_store_mode` | `"local"` | `local` or `repo-shared` |
| `auto_commit_enabled` | `true` | auto-create a local commit at closeout when verification passed and the working tree changed; `false` skips only the automatic commit |
| `commit_attribution` | `""` | optional text appended to commit messages |
| `install_mode` | `"standby"` | current default install mode |
| `host_install_modes` | `{}` | managed per-CLI mode map, such as `{ "codex": "standby" }`; recorded only after successful host setup and used before falling back to `install_mode` |

`auto_commit_enabled` is initialized to `true` only when the config file is first created. Later installs and updates only fill missing keys and do not overwrite your existing value.

## How Each CLI Is Integrated

### Claude Code

- standby writes `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- standby updates `~/.claude/settings.json` with managed hooks and permissions
- standby creates `~/.claude/helloagents -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents`
- global mode uses Claude Code's plugin system
- switching from global back to standby removes the native plugin first; if that cleanup fails, HelloAGENTS keeps Claude tracked as `global`

### Gemini CLI

- standby writes `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`
- standby updates `~/.gemini/settings.json` with managed hooks
- standby creates `~/.gemini/helloagents -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents`
- global mode uses Gemini's extension system
- switching from global back to standby removes the native extension first; if that cleanup fails, HelloAGENTS keeps Gemini tracked as `global`

### Codex CLI

Codex is rules-file driven by default.

- standby writes `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- standby writes a portable managed `model_instructions_file = "~/.codex/AGENTS.md"`
- standby writes a managed and portable `notify = ["helloagents-js", "codex-notify"]` command for closeout notification, so reinstalling, updating, or moving to another machine does not require rewriting an absolute path
- standby writes silent Codex hooks to `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- Codex `SessionStart` stays silent and reads the current `~/.helloagents/helloagents.json` at runtime instead of baking a config snapshot into `config.toml`, so first-turn and post-compaction settings stay current
- install and update also sync HelloAGENTS-managed Codex hook trust state in `~/.codex/config.toml`, so Codex 0.129.0+ does not re-prompt for the managed hooks
- that hook trust state is machine-local generated metadata derived from the current absolute `~/.codex/hooks.json` path; unlike `model_instructions_file = "~/.codex/AGENTS.md"`, it is not portable config and should be regenerated on each machine
- standby creates `~/.codex/helloagents -> ~/.helloagents/helloagents`
- global mode installs the native local-plugin chain, but keeps `~/.helloagents/helloagents` as the single managed runtime source by linking plugin roots, plugin cache, and `~/.codex/helloagents` back to it
- `doctor`, `cleanup`, and `uninstall` also recognize wrapped notify chains such as `--previous-notify ["helloagents-js", "codex-notify"]`, so Codex App / Computer Use wrappers do not cause false drift reports or break notify restoration
- for Codex app/plugin discovery, `global` is the native path; `standby` remains the lighter default for explicit project work
- cleanup removes only the HelloAGENTS-managed hook trust entries, while keeping user-owned hook state untouched
- Codex hooks only synchronize runtime state and enforce Stop gates; they do not inject HelloAGENTS rules or route text through hook output
- Codex closeout de-duplicates Stop hooks and native `codex-notify`, so one turn does not notify twice, and clientless delegated child-completion events stay silent when the managed Stop hook is active
- `/goal` remains Codex-native. Enable it explicitly with `helloagents codex goals enable` when long-running plan execution is needed
- Current OpenAI docs still mark `/goal` as experimental, and Codex app support is still preview. HelloAGENTS therefore treats `/goal` as an opt-in Codex-native accelerator, not as a required runtime dependency
- Goal-aware commands resume from `tasks.md`, `contract.json`, and `state_path`; they do not create goals automatically or mark them complete before HelloAGENTS verification and closeout

## Verification

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The current suite covers:

- install, update, cleanup, uninstall, branch switching, and mode switching
- stale lifecycle-env protection for direct `switch-branch` and package `preuninstall`
- Windows `.cmd` / `.bat` lifecycle dispatch without Node `DEP0190` warnings
- one-shot shell and PowerShell lifecycle dispatch, plus wrapper env cleanup and mode-routing rules for install, update, cleanup, uninstall, and branch switching
- Claude, Gemini, and Codex host integration behavior, including global-to-standby cleanup and failed native cleanup tracking
- Codex managed `model_instructions_file`, `notify`, `hooks.json`, hook trust state, local plugin, marketplace, and cache behavior
- Codex cleanup and canonical managed notify restoration rules, including wrapped `--previous-notify` chains
- Codex `/goal` feature toggles, long-running route context, and goal-aware command contracts
- `helloagents doctor`
- project storage and `repo-shared` behavior
- workspace-session scoped `state_path`, runtime signals, and evidence
- runtime injection, routing, guard, verification, visual evidence, delivery gates, closeout de-duplication, sub-agent wrapper and notification suppression, and successful-mode tracking after native install failures
- end-to-end host config write, update, cleanup, uninstall, mode-switch, and branch-switch flows across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI
- README and skill contract alignment

## FAQ

### What is the role of `docs/`?

`docs/` is reference material for users and AI agents. It may lag behind implementation; runtime behavior is defined by source code, rule templates, skills, templates, and tests.

### Is this a CLI tool or a prompt framework?

Both.

- `cli.mjs` handles install, update, cleanup, diagnostics, and host config
- rule templates define the loaded workflow rules
- `skills/` defines task-specific behavior
- `scripts/` provides runtime helpers for routing, guard, notify, verification, state, and evidence

### Should I use `~init` or `--global`?

Use `~init` inside a repo when you want to initialize that project workflow and sync project knowledge.

Use `helloagents --global` when you want host-wide deployment across supported CLIs.

### What is the difference between standby and global?

`standby` is lighter and explicit. It deploys rules to selected CLIs while leaving each repo uninitialized until you run `~init`.

`global` applies full rules broadly at the host level. Claude and Gemini use native plugin/extension installs. Codex uses the local-plugin path.
If you mainly want Codex app/plugin discoverability, use `global`. If you mainly want a lighter, explicit project workflow, keep `standby`.

### Do Codex hooks show injected content?

No HelloAGENTS rule or route text is injected through hooks. HelloAGENTS Codex hooks only write runtime state and enforce Stop gates; successful hooks stay quiet, while blocked or failed hooks show the necessary reason.

### Can I turn off notifications or guard checks?

Yes.

- set `notify_level` to `0` to disable notifications
- set `guard_enabled` to `false` to disable command guards

### Does `npm uninstall -g helloagents` remove project knowledge?

No. Run `npm explore -g helloagents -- npm run uninstall -- --all` before package removal so HelloAGENTS can reuse the tracked or detected mode for each CLI and clean host integrations plus the stable runtime copy. Project `.helloagents/` files and `~/.helloagents/helloagents.json` are intentionally preserved unless you remove them yourself.

## Troubleshooting

### `~help` is not recognized

Check:

```bash
npm list -g helloagents
helloagents doctor
```

Then restart the target CLI.

### A CLI appears installed but behavior is stale

Run:

```bash
helloagents doctor
helloagents update codex
helloagents --standby
helloagents --global
```

Use the command that matches your installed mode and target CLI.

### Codex still uses old files after a local branch switch

Refresh Codex:

```bash
helloagents update codex
```

For global mode, you can also run:

```bash
helloagents --global
```

### Notifications do not work

Check `notify_level` first.

- Windows: PowerShell must be able to show desktop notifications or play sound
- macOS: `afplay` should be available
- Linux: install `aplay`, `paplay`, or `notify-send`

### Guard blocks a command you intended to run

Review the command. Guard blocks known destructive operations and warns about risky writes. If you still want to disable it:

```json
{ "guard_enabled": false }
```
